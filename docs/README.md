### Git Workflow

---

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine
3.  **Commit** changes to your own branch
4.  **Push** your work back up to your fork
5.  Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE:

- Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
- Each page has a "Edit this page on GitHub" link. Click it to easily navigate to the blog post file. They are also located in `/src/blog` with a name such as `tip120.md`.
